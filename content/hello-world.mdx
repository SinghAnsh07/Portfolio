Hi, I'm Ansh Singh. I'm an introspective person who thinks things through before speaking. I feel things deeply, but it's often internal—a quiet observer trying to make sense of the world.

There's not much to know about me, or maybe there's a thing or two worth sharing. Let me tell you!


I really love making sketches. You can check them out in the gallery below—it took quite a bit of time to align them the way they are. I used a component from the ReactBits library called **Masonry**. Super cool!

I also enjoy playing chess. I'm not a prodigy or anything, but it keeps me engaged. I care deeply about meaning—why things work the way they do, why people feel the way they feel. I think about it often.

Growth isn't always linear. Take me, for example: I practically spent my entire first year thinking through stuff rather than doing it. But I did lock in eventually, and I guess it was worth it. I now know a lot of cool stuff, like this:

```javascript
const growth = (time, effort) => {
  // Sometimes you need to think before you act
  const reflection = time * 0.7;
  const action = effort * 1.3;
  
  return reflection + action; // Both matter
};
```

Professionally, I've built a lot of things. Technology is my language, though I also speak Hindi and English more fluently 😄. 

There's a quiet satisfaction in persistence—in staying with something until it finally makes sense. Sketching, especially, is where my inner world breathes. Sometimes I sketch to slow myself down, sometimes to make sense of feelings I don't yet have words for.

```jsx
// Life, simplified
const findPurpose = () => {
  const passions = ["coding", "sketching", "chess", "learning"];
  
  return passions.map(passion => {
    return `${passion} → growth → meaning`;
  });
};
```

All in all, I love learning—not as a checklist, but as a way of expanding how I see the world. There's a quiet confidence in knowing that I'm becoming more myself with time, not less.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore my work, and if something resonates with you, let's connect!
