hii, my name is Ansh Singh and I'm an introspective person. I usually think things through before I speak. I feel things deeply, but it's often internal.

not much to know about me, or maybe there are a thing or two. let me tell you!!

But Hey I really like to make sketches, you can check my sketches below, took a lot of time to align them the way they are. like I have used a component from the reactbits library to align them. its called "masonry", super cool right? So reactbits is like an awesome library for making our webpages more interactive and dynamic. I love it. 

Well keeping it aside, I also like to play some chess, I mean I'm not a prodigy or anything in it but it keeps me busy. I care deeply about the meaning. like why things work the way they do, why people feel the way they feel. I think about it often. I think growth is not dynamic though, like take me for example, I practically spent my entire first year thinking through stuff, rather than doing it but I did lock in and I guess it was worth it, I now know a lot of cool stuff.

Professionally, I have built a lot of things. Technology is my language, but I also hindi and english more fluently ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡. I think there’s a quiet satisfaction in persistence, in staying with something until it finally makes sense. Sketching, especially, is where my inner world breathes. Sometimes I sketch to slow myself down, sometimes to make sense of feelings I don’t yet have words for. 

All in all, I love learning, not as a checklist, but as a way of expanding how I see. There’s a quiet confidence in knowing that I’m becoming more myself with time, not less...
